USABLE tools resources focus on supporting maintainers of OSS, developer contributors and OSS tool teams to better understand design practices and how that can help them create more user centered tools.

There are currently **four** resources for the USABLE tools project: Usertesting can be fun: An FAQ, A dev's guide to usertesting, A dev's guide to synthesis and Developer and Designc collaboration in OSS.

USABLE is a collaboration between [Simply Secure](https://simplysecure.org/), [Okthanks](https://okthanks.com/) and [Internews](https://internews.org/) looking to build resources for OSS tool teams to help them understand design practices and how that can help them create more user centered tools.

User testing can be fun is the first resource of five created by the team at [Simply Secure](https://simplysecure.org/) for OSS tool teams about design.
