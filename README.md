# Dev's guide to...

This is the repo for 'A dev's (developer's) guide to...', as part of the [USABLE tools project](https://usable.tools/). On this microsite, you can find a series of resources with topics in: design collaboration, user testing, usability, synthesis and more. We decided to make the process of design more accessible and visible by documenting tangible, actionable ways of interacting with users with the goal to unlock the value of design. 

USABLE resources focus on supporting maintainers of OSS, developer contributors, and OSS tool teams so that they can create more user-centered tools.

There are currently **four** resources for the USABLE project: [User testing can be fun: An FAQ for small open source teams](https://usable.itch.io/user-testing-can-be-fun-a-guide-for-oss-developers-and-tool-teams-on-how-to-user), [A dev's guide to user testing: A roadmap for open source teams](https://eriolhugotest.github.io/devs-guide-to/a-dev-guide-to-usertesting/), [Synthesis for open source](https://eriolhugotest.github.io/devs-guide-to/synthesis-for-open-source/), and [Developer and Design collaboration in OSS](https://sosdesign.sustainoss.org/18).
