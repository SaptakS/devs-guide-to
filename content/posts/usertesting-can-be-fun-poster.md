We wanted to make sure that folks who prefer a 'static' resource for the 'Usertesting can be fun: An FAQ' can have access to the insights and advice too. Which is why we made a 'first version' of a poster that you can download and share as a digital resource or print as a poster to put up in a workspace. 

The poster version doesn't require an internet connection to play (like the ['Usertesting can be fun:An FAQ interactive guide](https://eriolhugotest.github.io/devs-guide-to/posts/user-testing-can-be-fun/)') as we recognise that not everyone globally has access to a stable connection all of the time and might just want a 'static' version of the FAQ tips and advice.

[You can download the high res .pdf hosted on our github repository here](#)

Unlike a repository of code ([like the interactive guide has here](https://github.com/simplysecure/usable-user-testing-can-be-fun)) where you can fork, clone, edit, play and submit improvements via issues and PR's to the games code the poster version can be iterated on and collaborated on in a similar way through using an open ['PenPot'](https://penpot.app/) file and then through uploading a 'finished' version of your remixed poster via a pull request to our [repository for the 'Usertesting can be fun: An FAQ' poster](https://github.com/simplysecure/usable-user-testing-can-be-fun-poster).

You can find our poster in a [PenPot 'shared prototype' here](https://design.penpot.app/#/view/5ac34dd0-8da2-11ec-a2fe-9eafb5cb1e0f?page-id=5ac34dd1-8da2-11ec-a2fe-9eafb5cb1e0f&section=interactions&index=0&share-id=7163d870-8da2-11ec-a2fe-9eafb5cb1e0f).
