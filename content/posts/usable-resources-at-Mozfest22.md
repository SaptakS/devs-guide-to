[Mozilla festival 2022](https://www.mozillafestival.org/en/#/) is 7th to 11th of March 2022 and the USABLE tools resource team have prepared a short skill share video about the current four resources here on this site for the Mozfest audience. Mozfest is 100% free to attend, you only need to [register for a ticket](https://www.mozillafestival.org/en/#/tito/Mozilla/mozilla-festival-2022/en/registrations/new?releases=rmddu9xc1hs,mozfest-mega-patron).

You can find the listing here on the [Mozfest 2022 schedule](https://schedule.mozillafestival.org/session/XG8YPK-1). In the skill share video we do a brief background on what we discovered when talking with OSS tool teams and split the remaining time giving brief explanations of the completed resources, how to use them and where to find them (here on this website!).

After Mozfest has ended we'll drop the public video link here so folks can watch outside of the festival schedule but for now, we're really proud of the work we've done on these first four resources and excited how they continue to develop.
