The [UX Forum 2022](https://usable.tools/blog/2022-02-07-uxforum2022/) is April 25th to the 29th and the call for proposals are out for submissions until March 11th 2022.

The folks who brought you the current USABLE tool here on this 'Dev's guide to...' are building a workshop sessiona round the second resource: [Dev's guide to user testing](https://simplysecure.github.io/devs-guide-to/a-dev-guide-to-usertesting/) which aims to take participants through practice user testing in order to help them get familiar with the planning and processes involved in preparing and conducting user testing.

Currently we're asking for tool teams who want to leanr and practice these user testing skills to either bring their own tool they work on or contribute to to form a practice user testing script and then practice with fellow workshops membersor come ready to pick up a sample, practice user testing 'role play' that we've prepared in advance. These role play's will give you the chance to practice the interview techniques and flows without the added pressure of 'delivering' on your own OSS tools you work on.

Watch this space for more information on the session at the UX Forum and how to sign up after the 25th of March 2022.
