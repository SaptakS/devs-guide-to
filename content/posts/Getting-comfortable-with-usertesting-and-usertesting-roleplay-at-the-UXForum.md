The [UX Forum 2022](https://usable.tools/blog/2022-02-07-uxforum2022/) is April 25th to the 29th and the call for proposals are out for submissions until March 11th 2022.

The folks from USABLE.tools and 'Dev's guide to...' are building a workshop session around the second resource: [Dev's guide to user testing](https://simplysecure.github.io/devs-guide-to/a-dev-guide-to-usertesting/). This session aims to take participants through practice user testing in order to help them get familiar with the planning and processes involved in preparing and conducting user testing.

Currently we're asking for tool teams who want to learn and practice these user testing skills to either bring their own tool they work on or participate with a sample user testing script and then practice with fellow workshoppers. These role plays will give you the chance to practice the interview techniques and flows without the added pressure of 'delivering' to your own OSS tools.

Watch this space for more information about the session at the UX Forum and how to sign up.
