#### What is this guide?
This guide focuses on informal, DIY, beginner ***user testing*** in a process that’s not rigorous but extremely valuable. As a short and practical guide, it helps teams get started, but shouldn’t be used to shift into a career of user research. 

#### Who is it for?
We wrote this guide with ***small*** (2-20 active contributors or maintainers), ***open source teams*** in mind. Even if you don’t have a dedicated designer or researcher on your team, user testing can be achievable (and fun!).
