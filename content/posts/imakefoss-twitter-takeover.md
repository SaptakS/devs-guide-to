From December 6th to 10th 2021, Kelsey, Eriol, and Hex took over the [IMakeFOSS Twitter account](https://twitter.com/imakefoss) to share the first USABLE resource ["User testing can be fun"](https://usable.itch.io/user-testing-can-be-fun-a-guide-for-oss-developers-and-tool-teams-on-how-to-user). 

Founded by [Jason Evangelho](https://twitter.com/KillYourFM) and [Jochen Spang](https://twitter.com/josp0001), IMakeFOSS is a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/imakefoss) and [website](https://imakefoss.org/) that gives a voice to open source projects around the world by letting contributors takeover the Tweeting on a weekly basis. Tweets are archived not only on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/imakefoss), but the well-organized [website](https://imakefoss.org/). 

It was a really great experience interacting with the community and sharing the UX side of OSS development. Behind the scenes, Kelsey and Eriol prepped the [Tweets and images](https://imakefoss.org/tweets/eriolandkelsey/), responded to comments, and overall had a blast!

In preparation for the takeover, Eriol and Kelsey (camouflaged as Fox and Skunk) participated in an [interview to introduce](https://imakefoss.org/curators/eriolfoxandkelseysmith/) themselves to the community. 

We're thankful that to UX designers got the chance to share our message about user testing. Thanks, IMakeFOSS!
