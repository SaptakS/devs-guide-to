After creating the [third resource in our user testing series](https://eriolhugotest.github.io/devs-guide-to/synthesis-for-open-source/) about the synthesis processes and [running a private workshop session](https://eriolhugotest.github.io/devs-guide-to/posts/synthesis-for-open-source-workshop/) to test the content with real OSS tool teams, we were successful in being invited to speak in the [Open Source Design devroom](https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/track/open_source_design/) at [FOSDEM 2022](https://fosdem.org/2022/). 

We had 20 mins to take the audience through the process of creating resources for the USABLE.tools project and why we focussed on creating the first three resources around user testing and synthesis before delving into the synthesis resource in detail. 

We went through the different sections within the third resource around synthesis and why it is an important phase not only for designers in OSS tool building but the wider OSS tool team. As we discovered through many of our initial interviews with OSS tool team members, it was difficult to understand what value design brings to an OSS tool and how it was difficult to understand where design improvements and insights come from. Along with these challenges the addition challenge of developers in OSS tool teams time constraints to participate in user testing can be condensed to participating in the synthesis process. This also gives the designers and developers in OSS tool teams time to collaborate and understand each others perspectives and roles in making the best OSS tool possible.

You can view the [video of the session that is self-hosted by FOSDEM here](https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/osd_synthesising_user_testing_insights_with_oss_tool_teams/).

Thank you to the team at [Open Source Design](https://opensourcedesign.net/) for inviting us to present at FOSDEM 2022.
