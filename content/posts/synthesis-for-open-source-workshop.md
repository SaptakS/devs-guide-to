After creating the third resource in our user testing series all about the synthesis processes, we wanted to understand how well the information on how to run and participate in a synthesis process was to real OSS tool teams. 

We piloted the content with sample content from previous OSS tool user research with 3 team members of unrelated OSS tools. The hypothesis was that regardless of your familiarity with the OSS tool or the user research that any OSS tool team member can participate in the synthesis process to gain a better understanding of what was achieved in the user testing/user research and 'get on the same page' as those that did conduct the user testing/user research. 

The OSS tool teams were taken through the general theory of synthesis post a user testing/user research phase, then taken through the goals of the user testing/user research. We then offered the participants to 3 kinds of user testing/user research outputs and did a preliminary synthesis of each output before doing a wider synthesis and grouping/theming exercise. This was done in the space of 90 mins which is a reduced time scope than we recommend in the resource but stands as a testement to what can be achieved in a sort amount of time when dedicating time to a synthesis process.

The workshop was private and therefore we protected the identities of the OSS tool team members but you can request a copy of our synthesis resource by reaching out to [usable@simplysecure.org](mailto:usable@simplysecure.org)

You can also check out our [session at FOSDEM 2022](https://eriolhugotest.github.io/devs-guide-to/posts/synthesis-for-open-source-at-fosdem22/) and watch a 20 minute video about the synthesis resource as well as some clips from the private synthesis session.
