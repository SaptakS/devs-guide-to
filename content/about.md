# Welcome to the resources for Usable.tools üß∞

[USABLE tools](https://usable.tools/) resources focus on supporting maintainers of OSS, developer contributors and OSS tool teams to better understand design practices and how that can help them create more user centered tools.

USABLE tools is a collaboration between [Simply Secure](https://simplysecure.org/), [Internews](https://internews.org/) and [Okthanks](https://okthanks.com/) collaborating to build resources for OSS tool teams to help them understand design practices and how that can help them create more user centered tools.

When we started working on the USABLE tools, we did spoke to several team members of OSS tools in order to better understand what aspects of user/human centred design remains unclear to them and that we could create resources in order to support the OSS tools team to develop their understanding and experience with user/human centred design. We completed 7 interviews with OSS tool team members and discovered insights such as:

1. 'Design and designers cost a lot' - Design was percieved as 'expensive'. When we begin to unpick this we find that Design is a less 'understandable and visible' aspects of software creation and development. Especially 'invisible' design work such as User Research, UX insights, facilitation, capacity building to build OSS team's 'common sense' design proficiency are often viewed as not 'outputs' and therefore 'waste of money'. Visual design is much easier to 'see' and therefore valued though visual design is harder to create and less user/human centred when the prior research hasn't been invested in. 

2. Design tooling is not as fit for purpose as developers tool sets. However, this came down to a mention of designers 'not being on github/gitlab' (or similar code base repository locations) and the difficult circumstances where critiquing designers tools and methods was happening while simultaniously expecting designers to work as proficiently in github/gitlab as most developers do. The key insight here is to invest time in building designers understanding of common OSS practices as well as the OSS tool teams building understanding of design practices. Plan for onboarding and welcoming beyond expecting design 'to read the OSS manual'.

3. How do OSS tool teams find designers and experts? Designers interested in OSS do exist and there are communities for them to communicate, collaborate and be discovered but the OSS tool teams have to 'go outside' of their sphere of comfort to find them and connect. This is common for a wide variety of diversity and inclusion needs within OSS and best described with the phrase `"You won't meet new kinds of people in your own house!"`

4. Working collaboratively with developers as early as possible on design needs was mentioned several times by interviewees as a way to have successful design in OSS happen. However, both designers and developers must invest time and effort in each others day to day processes and build trust for this collaboration to work. Valuing each other's time and skills becomes key here and removing as much constraint and tension within the collaboratiove relationship as possible. The emphasis here beyond how designer design 'what can be done in short time frames' for development and goes beyond to 'build trust and understanding well within the OSS in order to design effectively and specifically for real users'.

5. There are common differences in different developers understanding of design therefor not all designers will deliver what every developer needs to understand design e.g. some devs want a high fidelity prototypes super accurate grid some can work with wireframes and a style guide. The best approach here is understanding design terminology and practices and understanding what to ask for and how to enure a designer is set up for sucess to provide that.

6. Volunteer designers in OSS are 'too slow' (no slower than some OSS developers typically). Generally designers do not do all their work 'in the open' on github/gitlab and this can contribute to OSS tool teams not quite understanding how long 'good' design takes. Ensuring there is a plan for onboarding, mentoring and integration into the OSS tool does help with this.

7. Helping designers to 'upskill' and make the most of your community of users for both user/human insights into the OSS tool use beyond the 'developer users scratching their own itches with an OSS tool' means a lot of upfront investment by OSS tool teams and developers in the early design research phases like usertesting, usability research and synthesis and can be frustrating when there are 'already' a backlog of identified issues needing developer attention. Changes the focus here to how user research helps focus on the best problems for user first can go a long way to helping design and development in OSS tools work better together.

8. High risk users and human rights centred design for sensitive/safety OSS tools is a complex topic with detailed and careful considerations and needs. Open practices and design methods don't always work well with high risk users OSS tools and they need an understanding from a designer before they can be worked on.

### We decided to focus on 4 themes first üé¢

1. Delving deep into usertesting frequently asked questions and tensions from OSS tool teams
2. A detailed guide for OSS tool teams to better understand usertesting and practice the skills alongside designer/s.
3. Another detailed guide for OSS tool teams to take real usertesting insights from the usertesting guide and synthesise as a team to come together around an understanding of the users core problems.
4. An honest and frank discussion between designers and developers working on OSS tools right now about how to collaborate on a complex OSS tool.
