# Phase 2: Gathering your users for testing 🎣

---

Once you have your intentions documented, you can translate that information to recruit testers.

Make a list of possible outreach channels where your community gathers, such as: your email list, Twitter followers, bug reports, related communities on Reddit or Discord, your website, or your forum. You could also attend relevant conferences or events related to OSS or your tool and perform user testing during the event.

**Craft a screener (a short outreach message) that includes:**

- Who you are looking for, what kinds of ‘behaviours’ do you want from testers e.g. ‘We want people who use mobile banking daily’
- How much time they need to commit
- How they can contact you
- When you expect to conduct testing

It’s a good idea to filter your participants. Don’t accept all interested participants (that’s too much work!) or just the first people to respond (they might not match who you’re looking for). Your time is precious, find a few users who match your target audience the closest and try to get as many different types of users as possible [See “Phase 1 - Who”]({{< ref "planning-and-operations/#who-testers-" >}}). This could mean different types of use cases, people who are (un)familiar with the software, or various frequencies of use.

Once you find a candidate that fits what you’re looking for, send them a Calendly link (or similar booking tool). This makes the process easy from their perspective.

Unfortunately, this does not guarantee no-shows - that will happen from time to time. It could be helpful to send a reminder email a day before that confirms where and when you’re meeting.
